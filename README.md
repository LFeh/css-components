
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is an old project, when I made it in 2014 I was tried use some possibilities about HTML/CSS and I loved the result. So I know a lot of people that used these components in production projects (I've used a lot of times).

But the things changed in the nexts years and there are better choices to made these components.

So I just maintain this project as an experimental thing and I probability won't make changes anymore.

But you is free to use it as you want üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Browser Support

|          | Chrome  | Firefox  | Edge     | Safari 
| -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ---- |
| Android  | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes  | 
| iOS      | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes  | 
| Mac OS X | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes  |

\* [CSS3 transitions](https://caniuse.com/#search=css%20transition) are not supported in IE8 and below.
\*\* Janky z-index. See [tooltip on right example](https://css-components.felipefialho.com/#component-tooltip).

**Notes:**

- Most tests performed with Browserstack.
- Components that perform action on hover may not work on touchscreens eg. _dropdown with hover_. Oddly _tooltip_ does work. Bootstrap mentions this, ‚Äú[Sticky :hover/:focus on mobile.](https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-sticky-hover-mobile)
  Even though real hovering isn't possible on most touchscreens, most mobile browsers emulate hovering support and make :hover ‚Äòsticky‚Äô. In other words, :hover styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element.‚Äù
- Probably the main reason why the components fail in earlier versions of IE is because they use [advanced CSS selectors](https://caniuse.com/#search=CSS3%20selectors) which aren‚Äôt supported. It may be possible to patch this with the use of something like [selectivizr](https://selectivizr.com). This may defeat the purpose of using these javascript free components but on the other hand it may be acceptable for older IE.
- The components do not fail gracefully. In most cases some elements are visible but interaction will not have any effect. The _carousel_ component won't show anything.
- Some layout issues with _tab_ when wrapping on smaller screen sizes.
- Weird flash when _carousel_ loops around to first slide.
